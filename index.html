  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Hello!
  My name is Ji-Youn Jung, and I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. John Zimmerman.</p>

  <p>My research is at the forefront of Designing with AI, pushing the boundaries in two crucial areas: Firstly, I focus on shaping the early stages of the design process, implementing strategic interventions in AI applications to maximize benefits and minimize risks. Secondly, I leverage generative AI (GenAI) technology to refine and enhance these design processes. My goal is to deepen our understanding of AI as a design material, developing research-backed methodologies that are both practical and impactful in real-world applications. A highlight of my recent work includes integrating principles of fairness into the commercial early-stage AI innovation process, demonstrating how ethical considerations can be embedded from the ground up.</p>

  <p>I received MSc.Design for Interaction in the Industrial Design Engineering faculty at TU Delft in the Netherlands. I received my BSc in Human-Environment and Design at Yonsei University, where design was seen as an integrated system. Therefore I practiced graphic, product, fashion, and interaction design. While exploring different domains of design, I fell in love with the field of human-computer interaction, which led me to pursue a minor degree in Cognitive Science.</p>

  <p>A full list of my publications is available on my Google Scholar page! For more information about me, please refer to my CV. I update my news more regularly in Bluesky Social (@jiyounjung.bsky.social).</p>
