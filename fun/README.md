# For Fun Gallery

This directory contains the gallery page for the "For Fun" section of the website. The gallery showcases digital art, creative coding experiments, and design work in a clean grid layout.

## Structure

## Features

### Gallery Button
- Located at the bottom of the Graphic Design card in the main "For Fun" page
- Styled as an attractive button with gradient background
- Text: ">> Want to see my works? Click here! ðŸŽ¨"

### Gallery Page
- Clean grid layout that automatically adjusts to screen size
- Each image has a caption with title and description
- Hover effects with subtle animations
- Responsive design for all devices

### Navigation
