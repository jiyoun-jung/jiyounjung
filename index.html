    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Hello! 👋 I'm Ji-Youn Jung, a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/john-zimmerman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Zimmerman</a>.</p>
    
    <h4>My Research: Tools for Safer, More Successful AI Innovation</h4>
    
    <p class="accent-paragraph">My research tackles a critical challenge: <em>How can we innovate with AI responsibly and reduce the high failure rate of new AI ventures?</em> </p>
        
    <p class="accent-paragraph">I focus on the crucial, early stages of design before any code is written. I build tangible tools and methods that embed responsible AI (RAI) principles directly into the creative process, helping teams maximize value while proactively minimizing harm. I use Generative AI not just as a subject of study, but as a core technology to build these new, enhanced design processes.</p>
    
    <h4>Current Project: GenAI for Technology-to-Market Matchmaking</h4>
    
    <p class="accent-paragraph">My current project is a GenAI-powered system that automates <em>technology-to-market matchmaking</em>. This tool helps innovators with a novel technical capability—like a new algorithm or patent—systematically discover its most promising and safest market applications. It assesses thousands of possibilities against a unique framework of commercial, technical, ethical, and policy risks, empowering teams to build the right thing from the very beginning.</p>
    
    <h4>My Background</h4>
    
    <p class="accent-paragraph">My path to HCI began with an interdisciplinary design education. I received my MSc in <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/dfi/msc-design-for-interaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design for Interaction</a> from TU Delft and my BSc in <a href="https://yonsei.elsevierpure.com/en/organisations/department-of-integrated-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human-Environment and Design</a> from Yonsei University, where I practiced product, graphic, and interaction design. My passion for understanding the 'why' behind user behavior led me to a minor in Cognitive Science, which forms the foundation of my human-centered approach to AI.</p>
